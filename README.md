# About this organisation

The Global Omics Observatory Network (GLOMICON) aims to support the harmonised development of omics observatories the world over, by promoting best practices, coordination, and collective interfaces to other networks.

The [GLOMICON GitHub Organisation](https://github.com/GLOMICON) is a coordination space which
 * Indexes external repositories (via forks) which provide solutions for omics observation
 * Hosts repositories where code for GLOMICON-wide activities is developed
 
 Repos which will be updated - rather than simply indexed - within the GLOMICON org will have the following notice at the top of their README.Md:
 
 ```
 This repo is being modified within the GLOMICON organisation 
 ```
 
 All other forked repos are simply listed for coordination and visibility. 
 This complements other GLOMICON coordination resources, such as our [protocols.io group](https://www.protocols.io/groups/glomicon).
